# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

I have created a Work Day Sheduler for users to add their events to a daily planner to create a schedule. 
When users open the Work Day Scheduler they will notice a Date, Month Do and Time  presented to them. Then users  are presented with timeblocks( 9am - 5pm) they will choose the time and adds the event. A bule button on the left when pressed will save the event to the local storage. When the page is refreshed the event will be presented and saved. 
The past events will be shown in grey color, the on event will be shown as red color and the future events will be shown as green color. 
When 24 hours is passed all the past events will be cleared form local storage.




## I have included  :

* The URL of the deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository.
